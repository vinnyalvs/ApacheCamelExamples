# Apache Camel Examples!

Hi! Here are some Apache Camel examples using Spring Boot, only the first example is with pure java. I also use Maven as a dependency manager. 


# Folders

Each folder contains an example and its respectively source code and the pom.xml file

## Example 1: A simple route to file transfer



## Example 2: Camel + Spring Boot

This example shows Camel Integration with spring boot to build a simple REST consumer.

We use Spring Boot @RequestMapping and use ProducerTemplate to create new subroutes and then routes the REST requests trough Camel.
